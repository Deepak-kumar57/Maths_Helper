## Features

**Derivative Calculator**  
- Supports multi-variable symbolic differentiation  
- Clean LaTeX output for expressions and results

**Equation Solver**  
- Solves single-variable equations (e.g., `x^2 - 4 = 0`)  
- Automatically identifies the solving variable

**Graph Plotter**  
- Plots functions like `sin(x)/x`, `log(x)`, and polynomials  
- Customizable x-range and plot density

**Inequality Plotter**  
- Visualizes inequalities in two variables (e.g., `y > x^2`)  
- Plots shaded solution regions over a grid

**System of Equations Plotter**  
- Graphs two equations simultaneously  
- Finds symbolic intersection points and displays them visually
